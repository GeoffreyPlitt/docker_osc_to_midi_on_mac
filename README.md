# docker_audio_to_mac

This repository demonstrates low-latency bidirectional mapping of multitimbral MIDI input/output from Mac to a Docker container as OSC messages.
The Mac "owns" the midi deviec and the docker just sends/receives OSC.

## Quick Start

1. **Install honcho** (process manager):
   ```bash
   pip install honcho
   ```

2. **Run the complete demo**:
   ```bash
   honcho start
   ```
